            We consist of 50 different ethnic groups where each and every one respects and obeys there traditions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Because of many diffrent languages we adopted the Swahili language as one of our national language after English  so as we can all communicate and understand each other 
            during our dailly activities.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our national languages have united us and we have become one great nation of Peace, love and Unity.
            <br>
            <br>
            As Kenyans we treasure our foods and all ethnic groups have their own traditional foods for example the Agikuyu have the famous Githeri and Mokimo while the Luo have the tilapia fish
            All in all we all share a common staple food which is Ugali, Nyama Choma and Sukuma wiki.
